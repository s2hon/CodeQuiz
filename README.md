# CodeQuiz-hw4

*Objectives*

For this project my goal was to succesfully build a a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

The requirements were:
* a start button that will start the timer countdown & present user with the first question.
* for each question: 
    * user will answer by clicking on one of the four answers provided
    * when the user answers a question they will be presented with another question
    * if a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock
* when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over
* when game is over the user can save initials and score
* the score will be the remaining time left

*Reflection*

The hardest part of this assignment was to not only understand how the flow of the JS worked but to also build out the html and CSS respectively.
I started out by creating the html with bootstrap to lessen my work load. After, I coded out the CSS to make sure most of my items are aligned correctly on the page for a better user experience.
Before I started writing the code, I first-loosely-pseudo coded out the logic behind this application.
Then I went online and looked for some JavaScript questions on Quizlet.
I've referred to this (https://quizlet.com/117039332/javascript-quiz-flash-cards/.
) Quizlet set to build my questions.
I've also decided to add 5 seconds for every question answered correctly.

One of my biggest challenges was to figure out how to transfer the information to the scoreboard and to make sure when I create button elements for the answer to align them correctly.

I feel much more confident in my JavaScript skills compared to last week. I feel that it will get easier everyday but I have a long way to go to master JavaScript.
I will countinue on my JavaScript (and now jQuery!) journey this week.
